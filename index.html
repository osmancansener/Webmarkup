					<p>It may have been named after a farm that once stood here, but the 20th-century residential neighbourhood Bos en Lommer is far from being a rustic outpost. It’s recent – beautiful – renovation and increasingly-used nickname BoLo are sure-fire signs that this ‘hood is growing in popularity. And it’s not surprising when it boasts cool establishments like De School (a new club, music venue, restaurant, gym and exhibition space), WOW (a building that houses artists in residence, a restaurant and cultural events) and international cultural theatre Podium Mozaïek.</p>
					<p>Bos & Lommer is a place in Amsterdam - West. In Bos & Lommerplein you have a big market where you can buy a lot of stuff like clothes, food, toys etc. The market is a cozy place, because everyone there is friendly and wants to talk about something. Next to the market you have shops like Manzaram, Albert Heijn, Zeeman, La Chica etc. You can also buy fast food at KFC.</p> 
					<p>There are not many companies around Bos & Lommerplein. There are some cleaning companies, lawyer companies etc. Florya is the best restaurant & café in Bos & Lommer, because the service is very good and it is very cozy. If you love the hookah or good food that is the best place you can be in Bos & Lommer.</p>
